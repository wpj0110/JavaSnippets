Key Notes:
A lambda expression is not a regular object. Short answer is a lambda expression is a special kind of object.
An advantage of a lambda expression it is better for performance (memory wise).
For some cases when you need to execute a function, instead of creating an object for it with the keyword "new", it is
possible to create a lambda expression instead.
